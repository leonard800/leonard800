## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring front end engineer:
- ðŸŒ± Adaptive learner
- ðŸ‘¯ Team player
- ðŸ’» Believer of user-first design principles

I have over a year of learning experience as an intern, I have successfully delivered solutions to the challenges assigned to me. My work as a Web Developer involved optimizing website performance and enhancing user experience. Notably, I contributed to a 1000% increase in clicks and helped the SEO team achieve over 700,000 monthly site visits. I also worked closely with the product and marketing communication teams to implement two dedicated event pages, collaborating on feature implementations to create well-designed pages that significantly boosted user participation.

Let's chase opportunities together, godspeed! ðŸš€
